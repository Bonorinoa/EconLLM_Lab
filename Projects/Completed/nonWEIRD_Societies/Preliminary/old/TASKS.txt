Project 1

Replicating 15 small scale societies behavioral traits with LLMs. 
- Obtain eHRAF cultures data programmatically.
- Build Langchain Agent that collects relevant information about a given society.
- Engineer prompt using eHRAF data and the information collected by the Agent.
   - System prompt should use the information to describe, in detail, the relevant personality/behavioral traits the LLM must adopt.
   - Instruction prompt (let's call it experiment prompt) should contain the action we want it to take. I think these should be the experiments, but it may be smart to think of a template to help with replicability. 
   - The full prompt running an experiment is the concatenation of the two prompts.
-  We must create a new google colab to work on the code for the project. Make sure to keep it well documented and clean. We use a DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) style to improve clarity of the code.
Conversation with Emilio June 30:
   - Start working on documentation (Langchain to explain how it works, why is it the right tool to use for the specific purpose of the project).
   - Data: what we use, etc. explain this https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/
   - Prompts: 1. Profile of the 'decision maker' (we may have to check each of the 15 small societies samples to mirror them, if we find it to be too cumbersome, we would need to start with "key" societies (e.g. Ache, Hudzu, Tsimane (Kaplan at Chapman)).
   - Prompt 2: Tasks. We start with the endowment effect (see supporting literature for motivation). Next, one shot ultimatum Game (contingency plans to play). Risk attitudes and time preferences (we could use tools that people have developed for illiterate people and for playing in the field).
Conversation on July 12. 
   => Monica write prompts for experiments + data sources
   => Augusto finish the code
   => Emilio Practice langchain + find data
   Next week we will have a draft of what we are doing
