Ongoing Projects

- EconGPT: We aim to design and implement a data collection pipeline to obtain historical and biographical information about economic thinkers, including digital copies of their published work. Once this information is collected and stored, we experiment with various prompt engineering techniques to train an LLM (via in-context learning) to adopt the views and knowledge of any given economic thinker. The test case for proof of concept is on Adam Smith and the Theory of Moral Sentiments.

- ExperimentPromptDB: We intend to test a variety of LLMs on as many economic games and experiments as possible. As part of these endeavors, curating textual descriptions and instructions of these games is crucial to aid in the prompt engineering process. To facilitate this in the future, I propose we start developing a database of economic prompts and open-source it to the community. The result is expected to reduce testing and development time, as well as encourage people interested in testing similar ideas on their own, by providing centralized storage of curated prompts to run economic experiments on LLMs. 

Future Projects (under development)

- LLMBias: A systematic exploration of the sensitivity of LLMs to behavioral biases documented in the behavioral economics literature. This project aims to explore questions such as "Can LLMs be nudged?", "Do LLMs fall for the anchoring or confirmation bias?", etc. The results would provide insights into 1) the potential application of behavioral economics methods to evaluating LLMs, and 2) the similarities, or lack thereof, between human and LLM behavior.
