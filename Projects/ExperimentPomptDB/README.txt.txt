The goal for this is project is simple and concrete. We want to develop a database of textual descriptions of instructions from economic experiments or games. A structured collection of prompts, destined for LLM input, will facilitate model evaluation on such games. Ideally, this should be published applying it to evaluating the behavior of popular LLMs and open-sourced to the community.
