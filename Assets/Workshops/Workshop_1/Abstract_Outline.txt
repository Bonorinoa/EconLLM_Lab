Workshop 1: Foundational Models, LLMs, and Prompt Engineering Methods

In this half-day workshop, we plan to cover foundational models (FMs), with a special focus on LLMs, and prompt engineering. We will begin by offering an in-depth overview of the landscape of currently available LLMs, demystifying the distinctions between open-source and closed-source options. Participants will gain insights into the core components of these foundational models, enhancing their understanding of these powerful tools for natural language processing, and we will also touch upon alternative approaches to FM in the AI field like symbolic AI. 

As we progress, we will transition to the heart of practical applicationâ€”prompt engineering. Attendees will learn how to craft effective prompts that unlock the full potential of LLMs for their research and academic pursuits. By the end of this workshop, you will be well-prepared to navigate the world of foundational models, make informed decisions regarding LLM selection, and master the art of prompt engineering, empowering you to leverage these technologies to their fullest extent in your work.
